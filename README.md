Meet Gallery, your intelligent, lightweight, and lightning-fast photo and video gallery crafted
with Jetpack Compose. Gallery loads images faster than Google Photos or any other gallery app out
there. It is incredibly fast and uses very little device storageâ€”just 3MBsâ€”with almost no battery
usage. It boasts an awesome design and supports both light and dark mods. Plus, it contains a
built-in video player.

**This project is still in development and is expected to have bugs. Please report any bugs you find
in
the [Issues](https://github.com/iZakirSheikh/Gallery/issues) section.**
